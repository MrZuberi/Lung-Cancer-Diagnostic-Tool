# Lung Cancer Diagnostic Tool for the NeuraVia Hackathon

Lung Cancer Diagnostic Tool (NeuraVia Hackathon)
A proof-of-concept web application that uses a machine learning model to provide an initial risk assessment for lung cancer based on patient data. This tool is designed to assist healthcare professionals in the early stages of diagnosis.

🎯 Project Goal
Early detection of lung cancer significantly increases survival rates. This project aims to provide a simple, accessible tool that leverages machine learning to quickly analyze key patient metrics and flag high-risk cases that may require further investigation.

✨ Features
User-Friendly Interface: A clean web form for easy input of patient data.

ML-Powered Prediction: The backend uses a trained neural network to generate a risk score in real-time.

Clear Results: The prediction is displayed as a clear probability percentage and risk level (e.g., Low, Medium, High).

Data Security: All data is processed in memory and is not stored, ensuring patient privacy.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Machine Learning: TensorFlow (Keras), Scikit-learn, Pandas

Backend: Python, Flask

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

🚀 Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

Pip (Python Package Installer)

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/lung-cancer-diagnostic-tool.git
cd lung-cancer-diagnostic-tool

python app.py
Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to use the tool.

📊 Model Overview
The core of this tool is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model built with Keras. It was trained on a tabular dataset containing anonymized patient information.

The primary challenge was a moderate class imbalance (78/22 split), which was addressed using class weighting during training to ensure the model did not become biased towards the majority class. This technique improved the model's ability to correctly identify the high-risk minority class.

🔮 Future Improvements
Model Explainability: Integrate SHAP or LIME to explain why the model made a specific prediction.

Incorporate Imaging Data: Expand the model to analyze CT scan images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for a more comprehensive diagnosis.

Cloud Deployment: Deploy the application on a cloud platform like GCP, AWS, or Azure for wider accessibility.
